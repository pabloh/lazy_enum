Convert to lazy any ruby enumerable.


Eg.: (0..10**100).to_lazy.drop(1000).select {|x| x.prime? }.map {|x| x**2 }.take(100)

Which more or less means "take the square of the first 100 numbers between 0 and 10^100, that are prime and bigger than 1000".



Right now, this project is only thinkering.
